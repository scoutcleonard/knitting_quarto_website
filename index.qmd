**Welcome to my knitting blog!**

My name is Scout! [My professional website](scoutcleonard.github.io) was built using the R package `distill`: you can find it here! 

I wanted to try website-building using Quarto documents, though, and so I am trying this out as a place to share my personal passion: knitting! 

If you, too, knit and want to connect, [follow me on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/scoutcleonard)!
