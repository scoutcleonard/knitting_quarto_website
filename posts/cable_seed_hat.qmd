This yarn was so gorgeous to knit with. Soft, warm, bouncy, in a rich, green tone. The folded ribbing at the bottom made it all the warmer and delightful to try on as I knit closer and closer to the hat's top.

This pattern was actually the first I used with chart instructions, which went mostly well! I had a bit of trouble with the decreases, which are not actually part of the chart pattern, but it was difficult to execute with the text instructions. The resulting decreased cables are discretely imperfect, only perceptible to me, I think!
