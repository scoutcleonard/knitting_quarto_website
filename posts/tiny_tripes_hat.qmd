I had been wanting to knit a hat for my dad but unsure of a style he might like and wear, but fortunately he expressed strong interest in *my* Tiny Stripes Hat. Now, we have matching stripey hats.

Something that challenged me about both Tiny Stripes Hats that I knit is the transition between colors for each row. There must be a technique to make the transition more seamless looking, but both of my hats look a little muddled at the end-of-row transition from one color to the other. This makes a funny, fuzzy feature leading from the brim to the cap. 

I love the Tiny Stripes Hat because it is perfect for mild weather. It works great in my New England hometown for springtime and autumn chills, and all year round in the Bay Area, where the fog makes this hat a cozy staple.
