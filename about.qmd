- **Yarn Used:** Knit Picks Tuff Puff
- **Colorways:** Pomegranate and Snickerdoodle
- **Recipient:** My mom! 

I knit this sweater in spring of 2021. It's the 3rd sweater I knit after one grueling sweater that took one (1!) whole year. 

After that first tough one, I realized the fast and furious giagantic yarn patterns would be better for my learning. It is super gratifying to fly through the rows and helpful for my understanding to just knit through the whole sweater in a short amount of time. With the Kingston, I felt pretty confident about top-down raglan-style garment construction. 

The Knit Picks Tuff Puff Yarn wasn't bad for the low, low price of $6 per 100% wool skein. The yarn splits a bit, but the color choices are fantastic, and my mom would be horrified by the proce points of other yarns. Bargain yarn is more our style :)
