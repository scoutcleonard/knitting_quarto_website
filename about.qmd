I knit this sweater in spring of 2021. It's the 3rd sweater I knit after one grueling sweater that took one (1!) whole year.

After that first tough one, I realized the fast and furious giagantic yarn patterns would be better for my learning. It is super gratifying to fly through the rows and helpful for my understanding to just knit through the whole sweater in a short amount of time. With the Kingston, I felt pretty confident about top-down raglan-style garment construction.

The Knit Picks Tuff Puff Yarn wasn't bad for the low, low price of \$6 per 100% wool skein. The yarn splits a bit, but the color choices are fantastic, and bargain yarn is more our style :)

-   **Pattern:** [Cable Seed Hat](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/cable-seed-hat)
-   **Designer:** [Linlin C](https://www.ravelry.com/people/zijinyouyou)
-   **Yarn Used:** [Kelbourne Woolens Scout](https://kelbournewoolens.com/product/kelbourne-woolens-scout/) (*I was not at all swayed by the yarn name....*)
-   **Colorway:** Juniper Heather
-   **Recipient:** Papa ü´∂

This yarn was so gorgeous to knit with. Soft, warm, bouncy, in a rich, green tone. The folded ribbing at the bottom made it all the warmer and delightful to try on as I knit closer and closer to the hat's top.

This pattern was actually the first I used with chart instructions, which went mostly well! I had a bit of trouble with the decreases, which are not actually part of the chart pattern, but it was difficult to execute with the text instructions. The resulting decreased cables are discretely imperfect, only perceptible to me, I think!

I had been wanting to knit a hat for my dad but unsure of a style he might like and wear, but fortunately he expressed strong interest in *my* Tiny Stripes Hat. Now, we have matching stripey hats.

I love the Tiny Stripes Hat because it is perfect for mild weather. It works great in my New England hometown for springtime and autumn chills, and all year round in the Bay Area, where the fog makes this hat a cozy staple.
