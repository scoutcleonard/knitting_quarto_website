# Scout's Knitting Blog!

I wanted to try my hand at building a website in Quarto. My personal website is built using R Markdowns and the R package `distill`. Everyone _seems_ to be saying that R Markdowns are here to stay in the age of Quarto, so instead of overhaul my `distill` site, I built this toy one!

I love blabbering about my knitting projects, so it was nice to try different features of Quarto wesbites whilst putting down my thoughts about different patterns, yarns, and techniques :)
