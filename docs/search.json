Shane had some unfortunate bike repair problems that stopped our trip short. This was possibly for the best, since some of the roads around the lake really are sketchy for cyclists.\nShane biked back to the car on my bike (hilarious size mismatch!) while I sat with his broken bike at Emerald Bay, waiting for him to pick me up in the car. Fortunately, I had packed my knitting for the trip and got some rows in! Silver linings!\n\n\n\n\n\nI loved that my yarn matched the backdrop! This is one of my favorite shawls to wear becuase it is Sierras-colored.\n\n\nI‚Äôve also done my fair share of knitting in Yosemite National Park. I love visiting in winter when the crowds are scarce and I can actually wear my knits, but I equally enjoy sitting by the water in summer and having a backcountry crafternoon.\nHere, I am working on the Purl Soho Dovetail Scarf, which has become a staple in my wardrobe. The yarn was purchased at my favorite yarn store on the planet: Atelier in Truckee, California!\n\n\n\n\n\nBecca knits a hat at Cafenated Cafe in Berkeley, California,\n\n\nI also love knitting at cafes. And breweries. For a while, I met with my friend, Becca, shown in this tab, at cafes and parks to knit socially and enjoy conversation, fresh air, caffeine, and soft yarn!"

Soft, warm, bouncy, in a rich, green tone. The folded ribbing at the bottom made it all the warmer and delightful to try on as I knit closer and closer to the hat‚Äôs top.\nThis pattern was actually the first I used with chart instructions, which went mostly well! I had a bit of trouble with the decreases, which are not actually part of the chart pattern, but it was difficult to execute with the text instructions. The resulting decreased cables are discretely imperfect, only perceptible to me, I think!\n\n\n\nLinlin C‚Äôs reliable cable charting. It served me well in my first charting experience!"

    "text": "Phew! I did it! I know that other knitters enjoy socks because they are reliably short projects and so delightfully portable, but I struggle with them!\nIt‚Äôs that mental hurdle called second sock syndrome. Have you heard of it? Second sock syndrome is where the knitter crosses the finish line on sock #1 and feels jubilant at their great accomplishment. The will to pick up the needles and start over for sock #2, however, disappears and remains nowhere to be found.\nI feel like second sock syndrome is another one of those knitting things that can teach us about how we approach many other tasks in life. The insurmountable-ness of sock #2 reminds me of how I felt after passing in a big project or closing Zoom after a job interview I spent lots of time preparing for. It is really hard to have the momentum to start another big goal!!\nWith socks, I find that the momentum comes from breaking sock #2 into small, achievable tasks. This might be obvious, but something about telling my brain that I‚Äôll ‚Äújust cast on the stitches‚Äù makes the ankle, then the heel, then the foot and the toe all come faster :)\nFor more about the actual features of THESE socks, you should know that the top-down frill was new to me. I‚Äôve knit frills on scrunchies before, which start from the smallest circumference and gain stitches as you knit. This pattern started with a ton of stitches and decreased quickly to achieve the frill effect. Same architecture, different order of operations!\nThis is the second pattern I‚Äôve knit from Summer Lee. I also knit her Thicksgiving socks. I am always so struck by her beautiful photography and simple, yet striking patterns. She‚Äôs been an inspiring person to follow on Instagram and her work generally makes me think a little more about color and cleanness in my work.\nThe yarn is more crazy than the more muted and earthy colors I like to wear, but I went into the local yarn store where I grew up, and the quirkiness of this skein just spoke to me!\nI am wet blocking these as I write, and I am NERVOUS. I did not to a swatch (I know I am stupid for this. Someday I will learn‚Ä¶.), so we will see how the fit is altered. I‚Äôd say they were a bit loose when finished so hopefully they‚Äôll fit a little more snugly after blocking? Or maybe I am a delusional optimistic!\n\nCheck out my Ravelry page for this project!\nPattern: Shorty Sock Set\nDesigner: Summer Lee\nYarn Used: Threadhead Knits Co.¬†Plump Sock\nColorway: Vinyl‚Äôs Not Dead\nRecipient: Me ‚ù£Ô∏è"

It‚Äôs the 3rd sweater I knit after one grueling sweater that took one (1!) whole year.\nAfter that first tough one, I realized the fast and furious giagantic yarn patterns would be better for my learning. It is super gratifying to fly through the rows and helpful for my understanding to just knit through the whole sweater in a short amount of time. With the Kingston, I felt pretty confident about top-down raglan-style garment construction.\nThe Knit Picks Tuff Puff Yarn wasn‚Äôt bad for the low, low price of $6 per 100% wool skein. The yarn splits a bit, but the color choices are fantastic, and bargain yarn is more our style :)\n\n\n\nWe love a raglan shoulder MOMENT!"

Now, we have matching stripey hats.\nSomething that challenged me about both Tiny Stripes Hats that I knit is the transition between colors for each row. There must be a technique to make the transition more seamless looking, but both of my hats look a little muddled at the end-of-row transition from one color to the other. This makes a funny, fuzzy feature leading from the brim to the cap.\nI love the Tiny Stripes Hat because it is perfect for mild weather. It works great in my New England hometown for springtime and autumn chills, and all year round in the Bay Area, where the fog makes this hat a cozy staple.\n\n\n\nI am very serious about how useful this pattern is. Tiny Stripes Hat is more than a hat; it‚Äôs a staple!"
