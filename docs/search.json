Itâ€™s the 3rd sweater I knit after one grueling sweater that took one (1!) whole year.\nAfter that first tough one, I realized the fast and furious giagantic yarn patterns would be better for my learning. It is super gratifying to fly through the rows and helpful for my understanding to just knit through the whole sweater in a short amount of time. With the Kingston, I felt pretty confident about top-down raglan-style garment construction.\nThe Knit Picks Tuff Puff Yarn wasnâ€™t bad for the low, low price of $6 per 100% wool skein. The yarn splits a bit, but the color choices are fantastic, and my mom would be horrified by the price points of other yarns. Bargain yarn is more our style :)\n\n\n\nWe love a raglan shoulder MOMENT!\n\n\n\n\nCable Seed Hat\n\n\n\nPapa wearing his cable seed hat in downtown Truckee."
